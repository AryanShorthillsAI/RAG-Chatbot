This takes place on Dr. Mann's planet.\n\n\nThe script doesn't use the word \"boom\" directly to describe these explosions, but they are clearly significant and destructive events.  Which \"boom\" are you interested in?"

        "response": "The Protagonist is recruited into a mysterious organization called Tenet, which is fighting a \"cold war\" against a future threat that is manipulating time.  This enemy is using a technology called \"inversion\" which allows objects and people to move backwards through time.  The ultimate goal of the antagonists is to activate an \"algorithm\" that will supposedly bring about the end of the world.  Sator, the main antagonist, is dying of cancer and intends to trigger the algorithm upon his death via a dead man's switch. The Protagonist must work with his allies, including Neil and Ives, to prevent the activation of the algorithm and save the world. This involves complex operations involving inverted and non-inverted timelines, culminating in a temporal pincer movement.  The Protagonist also needs to navigate the complexities of his relationship with Kat, Sator's estranged wife, who is crucial to getting close to him.  The film explores themes of free will versus determinism within the context of inverted time."

        "response": "Leonard Shelby has anterograde amnesia, meaning he can't form new memories.  His wife was murdered, and he is obsessed with finding her killer. He uses Polaroids, tattoos, and notes to himself to track clues and compensate for his condition.  The story follows two timelines: one in black and white, which moves chronologically forward, showing Leonard talking on the phone, seemingly explaining his condition and Sammy Jankis's story, a supposed parallel case of anterograde amnesia. The other timeline is in color and unfolds in reverse chronological order, showing Leonard's actions as he hunts for his wife's killer. As the film progresses, these timelines converge, revealing the unreliable nature of Leonard's memories and the ways in which others manipulate him due to his condition.  The central mystery of the film is not only who killed Leonard's wife, but also the nature of Leonard's own actions and whether he is being manipulated into hurting innocent people."

Cobb explains this to Ariadne when he says, \"An idea is like a virus... Resilient... Highly contagious.  The smallest seed of an idea can grow to define or destroy your world.\"  In the movie, this is attempted on Robert Fischer, the heir to an energy conglomerate, with the goal of breaking up his father's empire."
